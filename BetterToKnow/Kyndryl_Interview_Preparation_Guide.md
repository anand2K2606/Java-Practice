# 1. Understand the Role & Expectations

* **Microsoft Power Automate expertise:** Build automated workflows across enterprise apps (SharePoint, Teams, Outlook, Dataverse, Azure Functions, REST APIs).
* **Full Stack development:** Hands-on with back-end(Java/Python/.NET) and front-end (React/Angular/HTML/CSS/JS) plus REST APIs, microservices. 
* **Automation & Cloud:** Design secure, scalable flows integrated with Azure/AWS services.
* **OOP & Design Patterns:** Ability to design extensible code using patterns (Factory, Singleton, Observer, Strategy, etc.).
* **DevOps & Modern Practices:** Git, CI/CD (Jenkins, ArgoCD), Docker, Kubernetes, IaC (Terraform/ARM templates).
* **Growth mindset & customer focus:** Emphasize continuous learning, certifications, and collaboration across teams and geographies.

# 2. 4-Week Preparation Roadmap

Week 1--2: Microsoft Power Automate & Low-Code Platform - Learn/Revise
Core Components: Flows (Automated, Instant, Scheduled, Business
Process), Connectors, DLP policies, Approvals, Trigger conditions, Error
handling, Integration with Azure Functions, Logic Apps, SharePoint,
Outlook. - Hands-on Projects: Automate email approvals with Teams
notifications, Create a flow calling an Azure Function for data
enrichment, Build a flow that writes data to Dataverse/SQL and
visualizes in Power BI. - Certifications: PL-900 (Power Platform
Fundamentals) or PL-200 (Power Platform Functional Consultant).

Week 2--3: Full Stack & Cloud - Back-end: Spring Boot microservices
(Java), REST APIs, JWT authentication, async processing. - Front-end:
React or Angular basics, consuming REST APIs, state management. - Cloud:
Azure (Functions, App Service, Storage, Key Vault, Service Bus), AWS
(Lambda, S3, API Gateway). - DevOps: CI/CD pipelines in Jenkins/GitHub
Actions, Dockerizing Spring Boot apps and deploying to
Kubernetes/AKS/EKS.

Week 3--4: CS Fundamentals & Interview Readiness - OOP & Design
Patterns: SOLID principles, Patterns like Singleton, Factory, Observer,
Strategy, Decorator. - Data Structures & Algorithms: Arrays, Strings,
HashMap/HashSet, LinkedList, Stacks/Queues, Trees/Graphs, Time & Space
complexity. - Behavioral / STAR Method: Prepare 5--6 success stories
(leadership, conflict resolution, customer focus, innovation). - Mock
Interviews: Use platforms like Pramp, InterviewBuddy, or peer practice.

# 3. Core Technical Topics Checklist

• Java/Python/.NET: OOP, multithreading, exception handling,
collections, REST APIs, unit testing. • SQL: Joins, indexing, window
functions, query optimization. • Power Automate: Custom connectors,
error handling, security (DLP, roles). • Cloud Security: Identity &
Access Mgmt (Azure AD, Keycloak), encryption at rest/in transit. •
DevOps: Git branching strategies, Kubernetes basics (pods, deployments,
services). • System Design: Designing scalable automation architecture
(event-driven, microservices, message queues).

# 4. Sample Interview Questions

A. Microsoft Power Automate - Explain the difference between Automated,
Instant, and Business Process flows. - How would you secure a flow that
connects to an external REST API? - Describe a scenario where you
handled failure or retries in Power Automate. - How do you use custom
connectors and why?

B. Full Stack / Coding - Java: Implement an LRU Cache using
LinkedHashMap. - Python: Parse a large JSON stream and insert into a
database efficiently. - Design a REST API for a task management app with
authentication and rate limiting. - Explain how you would deploy a
Spring Boot microservice to Kubernetes with zero downtime.

C. System Design - Design a scalable workflow automation platform for
processing millions of tasks per day. - How would you architect a system
that triggers a Power Automate flow on an AWS S3 upload?

D. DevOps - How do you implement CI/CD for a multi-service
application? - Explain blue/green vs. rolling deployments.

E. Behavioral (STAR) - Tell me about a time you optimized a process and
improved productivity. - Describe a situation where you had to learn a
new technology quickly to meet a deadline. - How do you handle conflict
when working with distributed teams?

# 5. Interview Rounds at Kyndryl (Typical Flow)

1.  HR/Screening: Background, resume walk-through, salary expectations.
2.  Technical Round 1: Power Automate deep dive + coding exercise.
3.  Technical Round 2: Full Stack + Cloud + System Design.
4.  Managerial/Behavioral: Team fit, customer orientation, growth
    mindset.
5.  HR/Offer Discussion.

# 6. Strategy for Each Round

• Before the Interview: Review your own projects and prepare to map them
to automation/business value. Be ready to whiteboard or share screen for
live coding. • During the Interview: Clarify requirements before coding.
Think aloud; explain trade-offs (scalability, cost, maintainability).
Emphasize customer success and collaboration. • After Each Round: Send a
concise thank-you email highlighting your excitement for the role and
key discussion points.

# 7. Final Tips

• Certifications Boost: Even if you don't complete them before
interview, start Azure Fundamentals (AZ-900) or AWS Cloud Practitioner
and mention "in progress." • Portfolio: Push sample Power Automate flows
or small full stack apps to GitHub. • Soft Skills: Showcase "growth
mindset" by sharing recent learning---e.g., "I recently built a Power
Automate flow integrating Azure Functions to learn serverless
automation." • Practice Mock HR Questions: Why Kyndryl? Describe a time
you went beyond your job description. How do you stay updated with new
tech?
